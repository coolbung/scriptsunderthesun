disqusparser.php
=================

Class to read a XML export file generated by DISQUS, get a list of unqiuqe links and visit those links to find out the HTTP status code for each. This is useful when you are migrating a site and your URLs have changed. The script saves the link and the HTTP status in a CSV file that you can use to do any further processing.

Usage : Best to run from the command line as

```sh
php disqusparser.php exportfile.xml 10
```
This will process and save the first 10 URLs only

```sh
php disqusparser.php exportfile.xml
```
This will process and save all URLs
