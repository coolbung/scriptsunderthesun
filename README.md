disqusparser.php
=================

Class to read a XML export file generated by DISQUS, get a list of unqiuqe links and visit those links to find out the HTTP status code for each. This is useful when you are migrating a site and your URLs have changed. The script saves the link and the HTTP status in a CSV file that you can use to do any further processing.

Usage : Best to run from the command line as

$ php disqusparser.php exportfile.xml 10 (Processes and saves the first 10 URLS only)

$ php disqusparser.php exportfile.xml (Processes and saves all URLs)
